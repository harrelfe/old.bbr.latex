A free web course in introductory and intermediate biostatistics
taught by Frank Harrell starts on October 4, 2019 at 10am US Eastern
Time.  This course is offered about three Fridays per month. 
The course is live streamed
on YouTube, and recorded for watching offline.  Recordings will
initially only be available to those who registered for the course.
Later the recordings will be archived on YouTube channel
[BBRcourse](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-o_ZZ0tuFUYn8e8rf-QURA).

The course is intended primarily for those doing research (especially
biomedical research) but also for consumers of biomedical research who sometimes
work with statisticians, to help those consumers understand study
design and interpret results of statistical analysis.
Statisticians may also enjoy the course and entering into the live
discussion on YouTube. 

The course content is aimed at exposing biomedical researchers
to modern biostatistical methods and statistical graphics, highlighting those methods that make
fewer assumptions, including nonparametric statistics and robust
statistical measures.  In addition to covering traditional estimation and inferential techniques, the course contrasts those with the Bayesian approach, and also includes several components
that have been increasingly important in the past few years, such as
challenges of high-dimensional data analysis, modeling for
observational treatment comparisons, analysis of differential
treatment effect (heterogeneity of treatment effect), statistical
methods for biomarker research, medical diagnostic research, and
methods for reproducible research. 

Frank Harrell and Chris Slaughter of the Department of Biostatistics,
Vanderbilt School of Medicine have created a free comprehensive set of
notes entitled Biostatistics for Biomedical Research available
[here](http://hbiostat.org/doc/bbr.pdf).  These notes comprise the
primary course material.  Non-statisticians are highly encouraged to
simultaneously study [The Analysis of Biological
Data](https://whitlockschluter.zoology.ubc.ca) by Whitlock and
Schluter, 2nd Edition.  Participants who have not had any statistics training are highly encouraged to read David Spiegelhalter's [The Art of Statistics](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Statistics-Learning-Pelican-Books/dp/0241398630) before the course starts.

It is recommended that you download the BBR
notes pdf file afresh for each session, as content will continually be
updated.  A list of significant changes made to the notes appears in
its page ix.

The main prerequisite for the course is a good understanding
of algebra.  For a crash course in algebra and links to some
exceptional free online resources for brushing up on your algebra
skills, read Chapter 2 of the [BBR
notes](http://hbiostat.org/doc/bbr.pdf).  Those who have not studied
probability and statistics before may also want to study some basic
ideas such as those presented [here](https://seeing-theory.brown.edu),
and watch some of the videos on probability that are linked from
Section 3.9 of the course notes.

The course is sponsored by the [Vanderbilt
Institute for Clinical and Translational
Research](https://victr.vumc.org) (VICTR) **Research Methods Program**
in the Department of Biostatistics  of the School of Medicine, and is done
in coordination with [Edge for Scholars](https://edgeforscholars.org).
VICTR is funded by the [National Center for Advancing Translational
Sciences](https://ncats.nih.gov) of NIH.  More
information and a place to suggest future topics may be found
[here](https://discourse.datamethods.org/t/bbr-video-course).  The
main course notes are [BBR](http://hbiostat.org/doc/bbr.pdf).

Participants are required to register [here](https://is.gd/bbrcourse) for the
course and in so doing 
must provide basic information that allows us to report aggregate
participant characteristics to our funding agencies.  A valid email
address is required for registration.  You need only register once
(not for each session).  You will receive an email confirmation
after registering.  Click [here](https://redcap.vanderbilt.edu/surveys/?s=9NCRDRNPEH) to access the registration site by its long URL if your system does not allow you to use the abbreviated URL above.

So that you will be able ask questions and get involved in more
in-depth discussions when the course is not live, it is strongly
recommended that you sign up on
[datamethods.org](http://datamethods.org) in advance.  Registration is
easy.  You must provide your real first and last name there, and you
can register using a variety of existing accounts such as Twitter.

## Course Schedule

## What to To

### Before a Session
* If you plan to download the course notes, download the latest
version no earlier than a day before each session
* Watch videos and view other materials that are assigned in advance
  for some of the sessions
* A few minutes before the scheduled start time for a session, go to
  the YouTube link emailed to you (beginning 2019-09-30 you will be
  emailed a URL you should bookmark, which links to a page that will
  contain the URLs for all videos as the sessions are created, so that
  follow-up emails will not be needed).  On the upper right of the browser 
  page that opens, select `Live Chat` instead of `Top Chat` in the
  pulldown menu.

### During a Session
* If you are viewing a live session and have a short question that has
  not been asked already, enter the question in the live chat.
  Questions should be general and not just related to a specific
  dataset or application.
* For longer questions and discussion that are in any way
  health-related, enter questions or topics for discussion in the
  `datamethods.org` topic above that was set up specifically for the
  current session.

### After a Session or if Participating by Watching Recordings
* Questions that are in some way health related should be entered in
  the `datamethods.org` topic specifically created for the session.
  Make sure that questions were not already answered in either the live
  chat or earlier in the `datamethods` topic.  If you are watching a
  recording of a session, the live chat is replayed as you watch.
