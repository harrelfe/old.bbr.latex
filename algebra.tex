\section{Overview}
Algebra and probability are underlying frameworks for basic statistics.  The
following elements of algebra are particularly important:
\bi
\item Understanding symbols as variables, and what they can stand for
\item Factoring out common terms: $axw + bx = x(aw + b)$
\item Factoring out negation of a series of added terms: $-a - b = -
  (a + b)$
\item Simplification of fractions
\item Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of fractions
\item Exponentiation with both fractional and whole number exponents
\item Re-writing exponentials of sums: $b^{u + v} = b^{u}\times b^{v}$
\item Logarithms
 \bi
 \item log to the base $b$ of $x$ = $\log_{b}x$ is the number $y$ such
   that $b^{y} = x$ 
 \item $\log_{b}b = 1$
 \item $\log_{b}b^{x} = x \log_{b}b = x$
 \item $\log_{b}a^{x} = x \log_{b}a$
 \item $\log_{b}a^{-x} = -x \log_{b}a$
 \item $\log_{b}(xy) = \log_{b}x + \log_{b}y$
 \item $\log_{b}\frac{x}{y} = \log_{b}x - \log_{b}y$
 \item When $b = e = 2.71828\ldots$, the base of the natural log,
   $\log_{e}(x)$ is often written as $\ln{x}$ or just $\log(x)$
 \item $\log e = \ln e = 1$
 \ei
\item Anti-logarithms: anti-log to the base $b$ of $x$ is $b^{x}$
 \bi
 \item The natural anti-logarithm is $e^{x}$, often often written as
   $\exp(x)$
 \item Anti-log is the inverse function of log; it ``undoes'' a log
 \ei
\item Understanding functions in general, including $\min(x, a)$ and
  $\max(x, a)$
\item Understanding indicator variables such as $[x=3]$ which can be
  thought of as true if $x=3$, false otherwise, or 1 if $x=3$, 0
  otherwise
 \bi
 \item $[x=3]\times y$ is $y$ if $x=3$, 0 otherwise
 \item $[x=3]\times[y=2] = [x=3 \textrm{~and~} y=2]$
 \item $[x=3] + 3\times [y=2] = 4$ if $x=3$ and $y=2$, $3$ if $y=2$
   and $x\neq 3$
 \item $x\times \max(x, 0) = x^{2}[x>0]$
 \item $\max(x, 0)$ or $w \times [x>0]$ are algebraic ways of saying
   to ignore something if a condition is not met
 \ei
\item Quadratic equations
\item Graphing equations
\ei
Once you get to multiple regression, some elements of vectors/linear
algebra are helpful, for example the vector or dot product, also
called the inner product:
\bi
\item Let $x$ stand for a vector of quantities $x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots,
  x_{p}$ (e.g., the values of $p$ variables for an animal such as age,
  blood pressure, etc.)
\item Let $\beta$ stand for another vector of quantities $\beta_{1},
  \beta_{2}, \ldots, \beta_{p}$ (e.g., weights / regression
  coefficients / slopes)
\item Then $x\beta$ is shorthand for $\beta_{1}x_{1}+\beta_{2}x_{2} +
  \ldots + \beta_{p}x_{p}$
\item $x\beta$ might represent a predicted value in multiple
  regression, and is known then as the \emph{linear predictor}
