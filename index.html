<p>A free web course in introductory and intermediate biostatistics taught by Frank Harrell starts on October 4, 2019 at 10am US Eastern Time. This course is offered about three Fridays per month. The course is live streamed on YouTube, and recorded for watching offline. Recordings will initially only be available to those who registered for the course. Later the recordings will be archived on YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-o_ZZ0tuFUYn8e8rf-QURA">BBRcourse</a>.</p>
<p>The course is intended primarily for those doing research (especially biomedical research) but also for consumers of biomedical research who sometimes work with statisticians, to help those consumers understand study design and interpret results of statistical analysis. Statisticians may also enjoy the course and entering into the live discussion on YouTube.</p>
<p>The course content is aimed at exposing biomedical researchers to modern biostatistical methods and statistical graphics, highlighting those methods that make fewer assumptions, including nonparametric statistics and robust statistical measures. In addition to covering traditional estimation and inferential techniques, the course contrasts those with the Bayesian approach, and also includes several components that have been increasingly important in the past few years, such as challenges of high-dimensional data analysis, modeling for observational treatment comparisons, analysis of differential treatment effect (heterogeneity of treatment effect), statistical methods for biomarker research, medical diagnostic research, and methods for reproducible research.</p>
<p>Frank Harrell and Chris Slaughter of the Department of Biostatistics, Vanderbilt School of Medicine have created a free comprehensive set of notes entitled Biostatistics for Biomedical Research available <a href="http://hbiostat.org/doc/bbr.pdf">here</a>. These notes comprise the primary course material. Non-statisticians are highly encouraged to simultaneously study <a href="https://whitlockschluter.zoology.ubc.ca">The Analysis of Biological Data</a> by Whitlock and Schluter, 2nd Edition. Participants who have not had any statistics training are highly encouraged to read David Spiegelhalterâ€™s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Art-Statistics-Learning-Pelican-Books/dp/0241398630">The Art of Statistics</a> before the course starts.</p>
<p>It is recommended that you download the BBR notes pdf file afresh for each session, as content will continually be updated. A list of significant changes made to the notes appears in its page ix.</p>
<p>The main prerequisite for the course is a good understanding of algebra. For a crash course in algebra and links to some exceptional free online resources for brushing up on your algebra skills, read Chapter 2 of the <a href="http://hbiostat.org/doc/bbr.pdf">BBR notes</a>. Those who have not studied probability and statistics before may also want to study some basic ideas such as those presented <a href="https://seeing-theory.brown.edu">here</a>, and watch some of the videos on probability that are linked from Section 3.9 of the course notes.</p>
<p>The course is sponsored by the <a href="https://victr.vumc.org">Vanderbilt Institute for Clinical and Translational Research</a> (VICTR) <strong>Research Methods Program</strong> in the Department of Biostatistics of the School of Medicine, and is done in coordination with <a href="https://edgeforscholars.org">Edge for Scholars</a>. VICTR is funded by the <a href="https://ncats.nih.gov">National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences</a> of NIH. More information and a place to suggest future topics may be found <a href="https://discourse.datamethods.org/t/bbr-video-course">here</a>. The main course notes are <a href="http://hbiostat.org/doc/bbr.pdf">BBR</a>.</p>
<p>Participants are required to register <a href="https://is.gd/bbrcourse">here</a> for the course and in so doing must provide basic information that allows us to report aggregate participant characteristics to our funding agencies. A valid email address is required for registration. You need only register once (not for each session). You will receive an email confirmation after registering. Click <a href="https://redcap.vanderbilt.edu/surveys/?s=9NCRDRNPEH">here</a> to access the registration site by its long URL if your system does not allow you to use the abbreviated URL above.</p>
<p>So that you will be able ask questions and get involved in more in-depth discussions when the course is not live, it is strongly recommended that you sign up on <a href="http://datamethods.org">datamethods.org</a> in advance. Registration is easy. You must provide your real first and last name there, and you can register using a variety of existing accounts such as Twitter.</p>

<li>If you plan to download the course notes, download the latest version no earlier than a day before each session</li>
<li>Watch videos and view other materials that are assigned in advance for some of the sessions</li>
<li>A few minutes before the scheduled start time for a session, go to the YouTube link emailed to you (beginning 2019-09-30 you will be emailed a URL you should bookmark, which links to a page that will contain the URLs for all videos as the sessions are created, so that follow-up emails will not be needed). On the upper right of the browser page that opens, select <code>Live Chat</code> instead of <code>Top Chat</code> in the pulldown menu.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="during-a-session">During a Session</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you are viewing a live session and have a short question that has not been asked already, enter the question in the live chat. Questions should be general and not just related to a specific dataset or application.</li>
<li>For longer questions and discussion that are in any way health-related, enter questions or topics for discussion in the <code>datamethods.org</code> topic above that was set up specifically for the current session.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="after-a-session-or-if-participating-by-watching-recordings">After a Session or if Participating by Watching Recordings</h3>
<ul>
<li>Questions that are in some way health related should be entered in the <code>datamethods.org</code> topic specifically created for the session. Make sure that questions were not already answered in either the live chat or earlier in the <code>datamethods</code> topic. If you are watching a recording of a session, the live chat is replayed as you watch.</li>
