\chapter{Introduction to the \R\ \co{rms} Package: The Linear Model}\alabel{chap:rmsintro}
Some of the purposes of the \co{rms} package are to
\bi
\item make everyday statistical modeling easier to do
\item make modern statistical methods easy to incorporate into everyday work
\item make it easy to use the bootstrap to validate models
\item provide ``model presentation graphics''
\ei
  
\section{Formula Language and Fitting Function}%\sound{rrms-1}
\bi
\item Statistical formula in \R:
<<eval=FALSE>>=
y ~ x1 + x2 + x3
@
\co{y} \emph{is modeled as} $\alpha + \beta_{1}x_{1} + \beta_{2}x_{2}
+ \beta_{3} x_{3}$.
\item \co{y} is the dependent variable/response/outcome, \co{x}'s are
  predictors (independent variables)
\item The formula is the first argument to a \emph{fitting}
  function (just as it is the first argument to a \co{trellis}
  graphics function)
\item \co{rms} (\emph{regression modeling strategies}) package~\cite{rrms}
  makes many aspects of regression modeling
  and graphical display of model results easier to do
\item \co{rms} does a lot of bookkeeping to
  remember details about the \emph{design matrix} for the model and to
  use these details in making automatic hypothesis tests, estimates,
  and plots.  The design matrix is the matrix of independent variables
  after coding them numerically and adding nonlinear and product terms
  if needed.
\item \co{rms} package fitting function for ordinary least squares
  regression (what is often called the \emph{linear model} or
  \emph{multiple linear regression}): \co{ols}
\item Example:\ipacue
<<eval=FALSE>>=
f <- ols(y ~ age + sys.bp, data=mydata)
@
\item \co{age} and \co{sys.bp} are the two predictors (independent
variables) assumed to have linear and additive effects (do not
interact or have synergism)
\item \co{mydata} is an \R\ \emph{data frame} containing at least
  three columns for the model's variables
\item \co{f} (the \emph{fit object}) is an \R\ list object, containing
  coefficients, variances, and many other quantities
\item Below, the fit object will be \co{f} throughout.  In practice,
  use any legal \R\  name, e.g. \co{fit.full.model}
\ei

\section{Operating on the Fit Object}%\sound{rrms-2}
\bi
\item Regression coefficient estimates may be obtained by any of the
  methods listed below
<<eval=FALSE>>=
f$coefficients
f$coef          # abbreviation
coef(f)         # use the coef extractor function
coef(f)[1]      # get intercept
f$coef[2]       # get 2nd coefficient (1st slope)
f$coef['age']   # get coefficient of age
coef(f)['age']  # ditto
@
\item But often we use \emph{methods} which do something more
  interesting with the model fit.
 \begin{description}
 \item[\co{print(f)}]: print coefficients, standard errors, $t$-test,
   other statistics; can also just type \co{f} to print
 \item[\co{fitted(f)}]: compute $\hat{y}$
 \item[\co{predict(f, newdata)}]: get predicted values, for subjects
   described in data frame \co{newdata}\footnote{You can get
     confidence limits for predicted means or predicted individual
     responses using the \co{conf.int} and \co{conf.type} arguments to
     \co{predict}.  \co{predict(f)} without the \co{newdata} argument
     yields the same result as \co{fitted(f)}.}
 \item[\co{r <- resid(f)}]: compute the vector of $n$ residuals
   (here, store it in \co{r})
 \item[\co{formula(f)}]: print the regression formula fitted
 \item[\co{anova(f)}]: print ANOVA table for all total and partial
   effects
 \item[\co{summary(f)}]: print estimates partial effects using
   meaningful changes in predictors
 \item[\co{Predict(f)}]: compute predicted values varying a few
   predictors at a time (convenient for plotting)
 \item[\co{ggplot(p)}]: plot partial effects, with predictor ranging
   over the $x$-axis, where \co{p} is the result of \co{Predict}
 \item[\co{g <- Function(f)}]: create an \R\ function that
   evaluates the analytic form of the fitted function
 \item[\co{nomogram(f)}]: draw a nomogram of the model
 \end{description}
\ei

\section{The \co{rms} \co{datadist} Function}%sound{rrms-3}%
\ipacue
To use \co{Predict, summary}, or \co{nomogram} in the \co{rms}
  package, you need to let \co{rms} first compute summaries of the
  distributional characteristics of the predictors:
<<eval=FALSE>>=
dd <- datadist(x1,x2,x3,...)   # generic form
dd <- datadist(age, sys.bp, sex)
dd <- datadist(mydataframe)    # for a whole data frame
options(datadist='dd')         # let rms know where to find
@
Note that the name \co{dd} can be any name you choose as long as you
use the same name in quotes to \co{options} that you specify
(unquoted) to the left of <- \co{datadist(...)}.  It is best to
invoke \co{datadist} early in your program before fitting any
models.  That way the \co{datadist} information is stored in the fit
  object so the model is self-contained.  That allows you to make
  plots in later sessions without worrying about \co{datadist}.  \\
\co{datadist} must be re-run if you add a new predictor or recode an
old one.  You can update it using for example
<<eval=FALSE>>=
dd <- datadist(dd, cholesterol, height)
# Adds or replaces cholesterol, height summary stats in dd
@

\section{Short Example}\alabel{sec:rmsintro-leadcontinuous}\ipacue\sound{rrms-4}\bmovie{15}\ddisc{15}
Consider the lead exposure dataset from B.\ Rosner \emph{Fundamentals
  of Biostatistics} and originally from Landrigan PJ~\emph{et al}, Lancet
1:708-715, March 29, 1975.  The study was of psychological and
neurologic well-being of children who lived near a lead smelting
plant.  The primary outcome measures are the Wechsler full-scale IQ
score (\co{iqf}) and the finger-wrist tapping score \co{maxfwt}.  The
dataset is available at \url{hbiostat.org/data}
and can be automatically downloaded and \co{load()}'d into \R\ using
the \co{Hmisc} package \co{getHdata} function.  For now we just
analyze lead exposure levels in 1972 and 1973, age, and
\co{maxfwt}\footnote{\co{maxfwt} might be better analyzed as an
  ordinal variable but as will be seen by residual plots it is also
  reasonably considered to be continuous and to satisfy ordinary
  regression assumptions.}.

\textbf{Note}: To easily run all the following commands, open \ipacue
\url{http://fharrell.com/code/bbr.zip}
and then open the file \co{8-rmsintro.r} contained in the \co{.zip}
file using \co{RStudio}.  Commands listed in previous sections were
not actually executed so they are marked with the \R\ comment symbol
(\#) and can be ignored.

lead <- upData(lead,
               keep=c('ld72', 'ld73', 'age', 'maxfwt'),
               labels=c(age='Age'),
               units=c(age='years', ld72='mg/100*ml', ld73='mg/100*ml'))

g
# Estimate mean maxfwt at age 10, .1 quantiles of ld72, ld73 and .9 quantile of ld73
# keeping ld72 at .1 quantile
g(age=10, ld72=21, ld73=c(21, 47))  # more exposure in 1973 decreased y by 6
# Get the same estimates another way but also get std. errors (*\ipacue*)
predict(f, data.frame(age=10, ld72=21, ld73=c(21, 47)), se.fit=TRUE)

\section{Operating on Residuals}\sound{rrms-5}
Residuals may be summarized and plotted just like any raw data
variable.
\bi
\item To plot residuals vs.\ each predictor, and to make a q-q plot to check normality of residuals, use these examples:
<<h=5,w=5,top=1>>=
r <- resid(f)
par(mfrow=c(2,2))   # 2x2 matrix of plots
plot(fitted(f), r); abline(h=0)  # yhat vs. r
with(lead, plot(age,  r));    abline(h=0)
with(lead, plot(ld73, r));    abline(h=0)
qqnorm(r)           # linearity indicates normality
qqline(as.numeric(r))
@
\ei

\section{Plotting Partial Effects}\sound{rrms-6}
\bi
\item \co{Predict} and \co{ggplot} makes one plot for each predictor
\item Predictor is on $x$-axis, $\hat{y}$ on the $y$-axis
\item Predictors not shown in plot are set to constants
 \bi
 \item median for continuous predictors
 \item mode for categorical ones
 \ei
\item For categorical predictor, estimates are shown only at data
  values
\item 0.95 pointwise confidence limits for $\hat{E}(y|x)$ are shown
  (add \co{conf.int=FALSE} to \co{Predict()} to suppress CLs)
\item Example: \ipacue
<<w=6,h=5>>=
ggplot(Predict(f))
@
\item To take control of which predictors are plotted, or to specify
  customized options: \ipacue
<<>>=
ggplot(Predict(f, age))   # plot age effect, using default range,
                          # 10th smallest to 10th largest age
@
<<>>=
ggplot(Predict(f, age=3:15))  # plot age=3,4,...,15 (*\ipacue*)
@
<<>>=
ggplot(Predict(f, age=seq(3,16,length=150)))   # plot age=3-16, 150 points (*\ipacue*)
@
\item To get confidence limits for $\hat{y}$: \ipacue
<<>>=
ggplot(Predict(f, age, conf.type='individual'))
@
\item To show both types of 0.99 confidence limits on one plot: \ipacue
<<>>=
p1 <- Predict(f, age, conf.int=0.99, conf.type='individual')
p2 <- Predict(f, age, conf.int=0.99, conf.type='mean')
p <- rbind(Individual=p1, Mean=p2)
ggplot(p)
@
\item Non-plotted variables are set to reference values (median and
  mode by default)
\item To control the settings of non-plotted values use e.g. \ipacue
<<>>=
ggplot(Predict(f, ld73, age=3))
@
\item To make separate lines for two ages: \ipacue
<<>>=
ggplot(Predict(f, ld73, age=c(3,9)))  # add ,conf.int=FALSE to suppress conf. bands
@
\item To plot a 3-d surface for two continuous predictors against
  $\hat{y}$; color coding for predicted mean \co{maxfwt} \ipacue
<<w=7,h=5>>=
bplot(Predict(f, ld72, ld73))
@
\ei

\section{Nomograms: Overall Depiction of Fitted Models} \sound{rrms-7}\ipacue
<<w=6,h=4>>=
plot(nomogram(f))
@
See \href{http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/155430/clarifications-regarding-reading-a-nomogram}{this}
for excellent examples showing how to read such nomograms.

\subsection{Point Estimates for Partial Effects} \sound{rrms-8}\ipacue
The \co{summary} function can compute point estimates and confidence
intervals for effects of individual predictors, holding other
predictors to selected constants.  The constants you hold other
predictors to will only matter when the other predictors interact with
the predictor whose effects are being displayed.

How predictors are changed depend on the type of predictor:
\bi
\item Categorical predictors: differences against the reference (most
  frequent) cell by default
\item Continuous predictors: inter-quartile-range effects by default
\ei
The estimated effects depend on the type of model:
\bi
\item \co{ols}: differences in means
\item logistic models: odds ratios and their logs
\item Cox models: hazard ratios and their logs
\item quantile regression: differences in quantiles
\ei

<<>>=
summary(f)         # inter-quartile-range effects (*\ipacue*)
summary(f, age=5)  # adjust age to 5 when examining ld72,ld73
                   # (no effect since no interactions in model)
summary(f, ld73=c(20, 40))  # effect of changing ld73 from 20 to 40
@

When a predictor has a linear effect, its slope is the one-unit change
in $Y$ when the predictor increases by one unit.  So the following
trick can be used to get a confidence interval for a slope: use
\co{summary} to get the confidence interval for the one-unit change:

<<>>=
summary(f, age=5:6)    # starting age irrelevant since age is linear (*\ipacue*)
@

There is a \co{plot} method for \co{summary} results.  By default it
shows 0.9, 0.95, and 0.99 confidence limits. \ipacue
<<h=2.5,top=2>>=
plot(summary(f))
@

\section{Getting Predicted Values}\sound{rrms-9}
\bi
\item Using \co{predict}
<<>>=
predict(f, data.frame(age=3, ld72=21, ld73=21))
# must specify all variables in the model

predict(f, data.frame(age=c(3, 10), ld72=21, ld73=c(21, 47)))
# predictions for (3,21,21) and (10,21,47)

newdat <- expand.grid(age=c(4, 8), ld72=c(21, 47), ld73=c(21, 47))
newdat
predict(f, newdat)     # 8 predictions

predict(f, newdat, conf.int=0.95)  # also get CLs for mean (*\ipacue*)
predict(f, newdat, conf.int=0.95, conf.type='individual')  # CLs for indiv.
@
See also \co{gendata}.
\item The brute-force way
<<>>=
# Model is b1 + b2*age + b3*ld72 + b4*ld73
b <- coef(f)
# For 3 year old with both lead exposures 21
b[1] + b[2]*3 + b[3]*21 + b[4]*21
@
\item Using \co{Function} function \ipacue
<<>>=
g <- Function(f)
g(age=c(3, 8), ld72=21, ld73=21)       # 2 predictions
g(age=3)              # 3 year old at median ld72, ld73
@
\ei

\section{ANOVA}\sound{rrms-10}
\bi
\item Use \co{anova(fitobject)} to get all total effects and
  individual partial effects
\item Use \co{anova(f,age,sex)} to get combined partial effects of
  \co{age} and \co{sex}, for example
\item Store result of \co{anova} in an object in you want to print it
  various ways, or to plot it:
<<>>=
an <- anova(f)
an                     # same as print(an)
print(an, 'names')     # print names of variables being tested
print(an, 'subscripts')# print subscripts in coef(f) (ignoring (*\ipacue*)
                       # the intercept) being tested
print(an, 'dots')      # a dot in each position being tested
anova(f, ld72, ld73)   # combine effects into a 2 d.f. test (*\ipacue*)
