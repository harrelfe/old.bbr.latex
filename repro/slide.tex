\subsubsection{Natural History of New Fields}
\quoteit{
Each new field has a rapid exponential growth of its literature over
5--8 years (``new field phase''), followed by an ``established field''
phase when growth rates are more modest, and then an ``over-maturity''
phase, where the rates of growth are similar to the growth of the
scientific literature at large or even smaller.  There is a parallel
in the spread of an infectious epidemic that emerges rapidly and gets
established when a large number of scientists (and articles) are
infected with these concepts.  Then momentum decreases, although many
scientists remain infected and continue to work on this field.  New
omics infections continuously arise in the scientific community.}{\citet{ion10exp}}

\item Donald Knuth found his own programming to be sub-optimal
\item Reasons for programming attack not documented in code; code hard to read
\item Invented \textbf{literate programming} in 1984
 \bi
 \item mix code with documentation in same file
 \item ``pretty printing'' customized to each, using \TeX
 \item not covered here: a new way of programming

\item Knuth invented the \co{noweb} system for combining two types of
 information in one file

 \item \emph{weaving} to separate non-program code
 \item \emph{tangling} to separate program code

\ei
See \url{http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/help/LitProg-FAQ}
\bi
\item Leslie Lamport made \TeX\ easier to use with a comprehensive
 macro package \LaTeX\ in 1986
\item Allows the writer to concern herself with structures of ideas,
not typesetting
\item \LaTeX\ is easily modifiable by users: new macros,
variables, \emph{if-then} structures, executing system commands (Perl,
etc.), drawing commands, etc.
\item S system: Chambers, Becker, Wilks of Bell Labs, 1976
\item \R\ created by Ihaka and Gentleman in 1993, grew partly as a response
 to non-availability of S-Plus on Linux and Mac
\item Friedrich Leisch developed Sweave in 2002
\item Yihui Xie developed \co{knitr} in 2011

\subsection{\co{knitr} Approach}
\bi
\item \co{knitr} is an \R\ package on CRAN
\item Uses \co{noweb} and an \co{sweave} style in \LaTeX; see
\url{yihui.name/knitr}, \cite{knitrbook}, \url{http://yihui.github.com/knitr}
\item \co{knitr} also works with \co{Markdown} and other languages
\item \co{knitr} is tightly integrated into \co{RStudio}
\item \emph{Insertions} are a major component
 \bi
 \item \R\ printout after code chunk producing the output; plain tables
 \item single \co{pdf} or \co{postscript} graphic after chunk,
 generates \LaTeX\ \co{includegraphics} command
 \item direct insertion of \LaTeX\ code produced by \R\ functions
 \item computed values inserted outside of code chunks
 \ei
\item Major advantages over Microsoft Word: composition time, batch
 mode, easily maintained scripts, beauty
\item \co{knitr} produces self-documenting reports with nice graphics,
to be given to clients
 \bi
 \item showing code demonstrates you are not doing ``pushbutton'' research
 \ei
\ei

\subsection{\co{knitr} Features}
\bi
\item \R\ code set off by lines containing only \verb|<<>>=|
\item \LaTeX\ text starts with a line containing only \verb|@|
\item \co{knitr} senses when a chunk produces a graphic (even without
  \emph{print()} and
  automatically includes the graphic in \LaTeX
\item All other lines sent to \LaTeX\ verbatim, \R\ code and output sent to
  \LaTeX\ by default but this can easily be overridden
\item Can specify that a chunk produces markup that is directly
  typeset; this is how complex \LaTeX\ tables generated by \R
\item Can include calculated variables directly in sentences, e.g.\\
 \verb|And the final answer is 3|.
 will produce ``And the final answer is 3.''
\item Easy to customize chunk options and add advanced features such
  as automatically creating a \LaTeX\ \co{figure} environment if a
  caption is given in the chunk header
\item Setup for advanced features, including code pretty-printing,
  shown at \url{http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/KnitrHowto}
\item Simplified interface to \co{tikz} graphics
\item Simplified implementation of caching
\item More automatic pretty--printing; support
  for \LaTeX\ \co{listings} package built--in

\subsubsection{Summary}
{\smaller[2]
Much of research that uses data analysis is not reproducible.
This can be for a variety of reasons, the most major one being poor
design and poor science.  Other causes include tweaking of
instrumentation, the use of poorly studied high-dimensional feature
selection algorithms, programming errors, lack of adequate
documentation of what was done, too much copy and paste of results
into manuscripts, and the use of spreadsheets and other interactive
data manipulation and analysis tools that do not provide a usable
audit trail of how results were obtained.  Even when a research
journal allows the authors the ``luxury'' of having space to describe
their methods, such text can never be specific enough for readers to
exactly reproduce what was done.  All too often, the authors
themselves are not able to reproduce their own results.  Being able to
reproduce an entire report or manuscript by issuing a single operating
system command when any element of the data change, the statistical
computing system is updated, graphics engines are improved, or the
approach to analysis is improved, is also a major time saver.}

{\smaller[2]
It has been said that the analysis code provides the ultimate
documentation of the ``what, when, and how'' for data analyses.  Eminent
computer scientist Donald Knuth invented literate programming in 1984
to provide programmers with the ability to mix code with documentation
in the same file, with ``pretty printing'' customized to each.
Lamport's \LaTeX, an offshoot of Knuth's \TeX\ typesetting system, became
a prime tool for printing beautiful program documentation and manuals.
When Friedrich Leisch developed Sweave in 2002, Knuth's literate
programming model exploded onto the statistical computing scene with a
highly functional and easy to use coding standard using \R\ and \LaTeX\
and for which the Emacs text editor has special dual editing modes
using ESS.  This approach has now been extended to other computing
systems and to word processors.  Using \R\ with \LaTeX\ to construct
reproducible statistical reports remains the most flexible approach
and yields the most beautiful reports, while using only free software.
One of the advantages of this platform is that there are many
high-level \R\ functions for producing \LaTeX\ markup code directly, and
the output of these functions are easily directly to the \LaTeX\ output
stream created by \co{knitr}.}
